## Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers that support:
- WebSocket connections
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Socket.IO client

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Cannot connect to server"**: Ensure server is running on port 3000
2. **"Room not found"**: Check room code is correct and room still exists
3. **"Not your turn"**: Wait for other players to complete their turns
4. **Page not loading**: Clear browser cache and refresh

### Port Issues
If port 3000 is busy, the server will automatically try the next available port.
